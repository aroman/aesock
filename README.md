_Telephone tag for the 21st century_

# History

Aesock is the result of years of cutting-edge research in the field of advanced cryptography and communicography.
It's more badass than Chuck Norris debugging a MIPS assembler with a [http://xkcd.com/378/](steady hand and a magnetized needle).

# Name

What does "Aesock" mean? Good question! It's a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau](portmanteau) of "Aesop" (as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop_Rock](Aesop Rock)) and "Sock" as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networ_socket](Socket).

# Features

100% unreversible (or your money back) two-way cipher.

This is the only cipher currently known to exist that will still be cryptographically sound even when P=NP.
umad, science?
